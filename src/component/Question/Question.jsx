                    <h3>1. Difference between State and Props ?</h3>
                    <p>Ans:
                        Props make components reusable. And State cannot make components reusable. Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.And State holds information about the components.

                    <h3>3. What can use effect do other than loadÂ data?</h3>
                    <p>Ans:
                        If we pass in the prop variable to the array in the 2nd argument of useEffect , the callback that we pass into the 1st argument will run as the prop changes.

                    <p>Ans:
                        React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.
